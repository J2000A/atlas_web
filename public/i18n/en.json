His dissertation topic was Efficiency and/or Equity? Understanding and planning bikesharing based on spatial fairness. He is a graduate of the International Master's Program in Transportation Systems at the Technical University of Munich and has a background in civil engineering. His research focuses on raising awareness and assessing and addressing mobility inequities. His main methods are mixed-methods approaches, combining spatial analysis and machine learning with qualitative techniques.",

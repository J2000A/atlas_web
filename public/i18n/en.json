His dissertation topic was Efficiency and/or Equity? Understanding and planning bikesharing based on spatial fairness. He is a graduate of the International Master's Program in Transportation Systems at the Technical University of Munich and has a background in civil engineering. His research focuses on raising awareness and assessing and addressing mobility inequities. His main methods are mixed-methods approaches, combining spatial analysis and machine learning with qualitative techniques.",

    "index_goal_text2": "The Mobility (In)Justice Atlas is intended to support political decision-makers, planners and the general public in identifying and visualising mobility injustice in Munich. Neighbourhoods are shown where a high proportion of disadvantaged groups live and where there are fewer mobility resources or heavy traffic congestion. Due to the many possible scenarios, this atlas shows examples of the analysed disadvantaged groups and negative external effects. Based on this, decisions can be made for future mobility projects.",
    "index_definition_title": "How is mobility injustice defined:",
    "index_definition_text": "From a socio-demographic and economic perspective, the focus is on analysing six main social groups that are defined as disadvantaged: Older population, Children & Teenagers, Migrant population, unemployed, single parents and low income. This atlas focuses on two types of justice: Distributive justice: assessed by the availability of transport modes and infrastructure (e.g. car-sharing membership), bicycle ownership and cycling infrastructure (cycle paths), proximity to public transport, number of crossings (pedestrian friendliness) and accessibility to services of general interest (points of interest). Environmental justice: The indicators of the analysis are three negative effects of traffic on the population - traffic accidents, noise pollution and air pollution. Mobility injustice thus defines the unavailability of environmental and distributive justice, which particularly affects the six groups listed above.",
    "index_functionality_title": "Mobile app and Roadmap",
    "index_functionality_text": "The participation of the entire population of Munich is extremely important to us. This is why we have developed an initial vision of the JustFairMobility app, which you are welcome to use. In addition to reporting current problems, you can also take part in surveys to further reduce mobility injustice.This online version will also be further optimised: In addition to further data sources, we will be displaying the various points of interest in more detail in future, implementing a version for transport planners and a selection between day and night.",

You can view these data separately (to be determined as the tab is named) or collectively in the network representation. In the former, critical areas (red), non-critical areas (light or dark gray), and positive areas (blue) can be easily identified through color coding. In the network representation, you can see how the district compares to other neighborhoods (0: worst district, 1: best district).",
